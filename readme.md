## How It's Made

The "source" is markdown files found in `/md`.  That's where all the content is stored.

The builder file, `build.py`, makes use of Pandoc to create the files. It takes the markdown files as input, and outputs files to `/html` and `/pdf` directories. The web pages are made from templates, found in the `/templates` directory.
